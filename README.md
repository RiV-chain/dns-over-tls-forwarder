# dns-over-tls-forwarder

[![Go Report](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/mikispag/dns-over-tls-forwarder)](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/mikispag/dns-over-tls-forwarder)

A simple, fast DNS-over-TLS forwarding server with hybrid LRU/MFA caching written in Go.

The server forwards to an user-specified list of upstream DNS-over-TLS servers in parallel, returning and caching the first result received.

## Upstream servers

The default list of upstream servers is:

- **CloudFlare** `one.one.one.one:853@1.1.1.1`
- **Google** `dns.google:853@8.8.8.8`

Other popular upstream servers known to support DNS-over-TLS are:

- **Quad9 (filters malware)** `dns.quad9.net:853@9.9.9.9`
- **Quad9 (no filtering)** `dns10.quad9.net:853@9.9.9.10`

A custom comma-separated list of upstream servers can be specified with the `-s` command line flag.

## Usage

```console
  -a address:port
    	address:port to listen on. In order to listen on the loopback interface only, use `127.0.0.1:53`. To listen on any interface, use `:53` (default ":53")
  -d	print debug log messages
  -em
    	collect metrics on evictions
  -l string
    	log file path
  -minTTL minTTL
    	minimum TTL in seconds to send to clients. If the TTL provided upstream is smaller, minTTL is used. (default 60)
  -pprof int
    	port to use for pprof debugging. If set to 0 (default) pprof will not be started.
  -s string
    	comma-separated list of upstream servers (default "one.one.one.one:853@1.1.1.1,dns.google:853@8.8.8.8")
```
